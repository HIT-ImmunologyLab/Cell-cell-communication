<strong>description:</strong>  The authors quantified the aggregated activity of various immune gene modules, which were manually curated to capture important components of the immune system (Extended Data Fig. 4b, Supplementary Table 4). They observed widespread activity of these immune gene modules in structural cells, with highly cell-type-specific and organ-specific patterns.<br>
